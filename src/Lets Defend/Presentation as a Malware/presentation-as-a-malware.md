## Question 4
Which process is running to persistent under mshta.exe after the relevant malware runs?

To find the processes running under `mshta.exe` I would need to visit the Processes Tree section of the Behavior tab results. Here I found three processes under `mshta.exe`:

- powershell.exe
- schtasks.exe
- cmd.exe

Since the question is asking about persistence, it is likely the `schtasks.exe` is the one I need since it can be used to create persistence by executing code on a set frequency.

Answer:

`schtasks.exe`

## Question 5
If there was a snort IDS in the environment at the time of the incident, which rules would it match?

Further up on the page in the results was a section called Crowdsourced IDS rules. In it was a suggested Snort rule to catch this threat.
