## Question 1
What IP address does the program use to create the socket connection?

I unzipped and opened the challenge file to discover it was full of readable and unreadable text. In order to find the referenced IP addresses I wanted to extract the readable strings out of the file. To do this I did some research and discovered the following PowerShell command:

```
Get-Content C:\Users\LetsDefend\Desktop\ChallengeFile\downloader | Select-String -Pattern "[\x20-\x7E]+" -AllMatches | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches.Value }
```
