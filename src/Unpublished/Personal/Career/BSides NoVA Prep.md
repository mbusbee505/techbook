# Polish the headline
 
 > “I’m Michael—running help-desk & endpoint triage at Shenandoah University while building a Splunk-fed lab at home. I’m pivoting into a SOC analyst role—especially threat hunting & detection engineering.”


 Practice until it’s <30 s, then add one open-ended question (“What’s the coolest problem you’ve solved lately?”).

# Map the venue & commute
 
George Mason University — Mason Square, [3351 Fairfax Dr., Arlington](https://maps.apple/p/f5uUzE6RVJ.uZW). Van Metre Hall garage is the easiest parking; the Virginia Square–GMU Metro stop is one block away.

# Networking tactics 

| **Moment**          | **Action**                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Walking into a room | Sit near the front corner; turn to neighbor: “Hey, I’m Michael—what drew you to this talk?”                                                                        |
| After a workshop    | Thank the speaker with a specific note (“Your diagram on EDR event IDs hit home—I ingest those into Elastic in my lab”). Ask to connect on LinkedIn _on the spot_. |
| Hallway gaps        | Stand near swag tables or charging stations—people naturally pause. Comment on their badge ribbon, T-shirt, or previous talk.                                      |
| Villages/CTF        | Join a group already puzzling over something and **ask a clarifying question** rather than offering an opinion first.                                              |
| Social energy dip   | Step outside, jot bullet-point reflections in Notes, take 5 deep breaths, re-enter with one prepared opener.                                                       |
# Conversation starters

- “Which talk has surprised you the most so far?”
- “I’m debating between the Unicode session and the Raspberry Pi AirPlay talk—any thoughts?”
- “I saw you’ve got a _[company]_ logo—do you use Splunk or Elastic more heavily in your SOC?”
- “How did you solve that challenge in the Breach Village?”

# Logistics & comfort checklist

- 🪪 Government ID & ticket QR code
- 🔋 Power bank + two USB-C cables
- 📝 Notebook & two pens (writing a speaker’s quote by hand is memorable)
- 💧 Water bottle; light snacks (protein bar)
- 🎧 Earbuds for quick recharge breaks
- 🚘 From Strasburg: ≈ 75 min drive; aim to **arrive 7:15 AM Friday** to park easily. Traffic on I-66 eastbound spikes after 7:30.
