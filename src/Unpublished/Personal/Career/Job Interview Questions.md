| #     | Question                                                                                      | What the interviewer is listening for                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **1** | _Walk me through the incident-response lifecycle and where a Tier 1 SOC analyst fits in._     | Clear 4-step flow (Preparation → Detection/Analysis → Containment/Eradication → Recovery/Lessons). Highlight Tier 1 tasks: alert triage, initial severity rating, escalation criteria.                                |
| **2** | _You notice a spike in failed logins from a single external IP. How do you handle it?_        | Structured triage: gather context (user, geo, timeframe), check known-bad IP feeds, isolate affected accounts, escalate if threshold met; mention log sources (AD, VPN, firewall) and ticket documentation.           |
| **3** | _Explain how Sysmon and Zeek complement each other in your home lab._                         | Endpoint vs. network visibility; Sysmon for process/registry/DNS, Zeek for protocol metadata; correlating both in Elastic to reduce blind spots.                                                                      |
| **4** | _Describe a time you prevented or detected fraud (or potential fraud) in your previous role._ | STAR format: Situation (wire transfer), Task (verify legitimacy), Action (extra call-back, cross-check notes, escalate), Result (transaction held / customer assets protected). Quantify if possible (“saved $xx k”). |
| **5** | _What KPIs would you track to measure SOC effectiveness?_                                     | MTTR, mean time to detect, false-positive rate, incident closure SLA, percent escalated vs. auto-closed; tie to continuous improvement.                                                                               |
