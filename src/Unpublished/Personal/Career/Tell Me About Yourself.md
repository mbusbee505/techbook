“Hi, I’m Michael Busbee. I’m an IT Help-Desk specialist at Shenandoah University with CySA+ and Sec+. Day-to-day I image new Windows and macOS endpoints, verify the BitDefender EDR agent is installed, and resolve user tickets ranging from software installs to basic network issues.

Before that, I worked in Advanced Account Services at Navy Federal Credit Union, where I executed high-risk domestic and international wire transfers—closely monitoring each step for potential fraud and escalating any red flags to Loss Prevention.

Outside of work, I run an Elastic Stack home lab: I ingest Sysmon and Zeek logs and craft TOML detection rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, validating them with Atomic Red Team.

I’m now seeking a Tier 1 SOC analyst position where I can triage alerts, tune detection logic, and grow into detection engineering.”
