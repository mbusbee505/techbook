If you purchase a 10mg vial of Retatrutide from any source, like _Solution Peptides_, the mixing instructions are simple. Just add 2mL of bacteriostatic water for reconstitution, and then if you want to inject a typical dose that I’ve seen people use with high efficacy, inject 0.4mL for 2mg a week. If you elect to use their cheap Ozempic instead, the amount of bacteriostatic water to add is also 2mL.
