1. Don’t skip it.
2. Eat before you show up to avoid getting intoxicated.
3. Wear what you wore to the office. The guy who changed into skinny jeans and his "going out" shirt clearly has too much free time.
4. Show up on time. Most seniors do. Hang out with them for the first half hour, and then keep your distance. 
5. Don’t act excited about the open bar.
6. Don’t talk shop.
7. Don’t flirt or dance with junior staff at the main event. Wait until the after party.
8. Get your adversaries as drunk as possible.
9. Hold your wine glass by the stem. And in your left hand.
10. Hang out with the assistants. They know all the good gossip.
11. No social media. If you’re posting to Instagram or Snapchat, people won’t trust you.
12. Don't do or anything inappropriate; it's still work and HR never stops working.
13. Thank the person who organized the party logistics.
14. Leave early, but not first.
15. Put your card behind the bar at the after party. It makes you the designated leader.
16. Make sure your iPhone alarm clock is already set for the morning.
17. Always be first into the office the next day.
