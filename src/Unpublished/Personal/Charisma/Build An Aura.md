Aura is a game of vibration and armor against such vibration. You already emit what you possess, but aura refers to the quality and power of the energy shielding you. Everybody has an aura; the question is whether it is more receptive or not; if it is receptive, you will succumb to other people's auras; if it is less receptive, that is powerful; everyone else will be receptive to you and will wander in your company.

Aura:
- More Receptive
	- Succumb to the aura of others
- Less Receptive
	- Others will succumb to your aura

Everyone is constantly sending their vibrations, but having an aura means rejecting the low quality ones and only being sensitive to the high quality. This rejection occurs automatically as your shield becomes more powerful. There are many subtle ways to create a powerful aura.

- Reject Low Quality Vibrations
- Filter all but High Quality Vibrations
- How does one recognize the difference?

Aura is a reflection of your internal vibrations and ideas, thus you must play with them, which means handling them with care. Stop allowing any thoughts to enter your mind and defend them firmly. Be very choosy about everything you consume, hear, read, and say. Speak as little as possible, don't use your eyes too much, keep your gaze fixed on one spot, don't use too much of your neck, keep a firm grip on it, use fewer of your senses, eat less, and accept yourself as a complete being in need of nothing. 

- Aura is a reflection of internal state
- Be choosy about everything you consume, hear, read, say
- Minimize speaking
- Minimize looking around
- Minimize neck movement
- Minimize over-indulging the senses
- Eat less
- Recognize and Accept yourself as a complete being
