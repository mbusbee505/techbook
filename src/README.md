# BusbeeTech

This is where I park my lab notes and how-tos—take what you need and break things with me. The Intune-Lab is now wrapped up, so if you want a zero-touch Windows 11 deployment that’s ready for a new hire in under an hour, start there. Next I’m kicking off the SOC101-Lab, wiring Zeek sensors into Splunk and Elastic, tossing Atomic Red Team at the targets, and tuning detections as I go. Stick around if that sounds fun.
